        Actually the name vegetable 65 is because, here mixed vegetables are cooked 65 style. Now what is 65
        style? Somebody told me, It's an Indian style, which means it has 65 ingredients. But don't worry, I have
        made it a bit simpler for you and used very less ingredients with the same great taste.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Cut the vegetables into medium size using a chopping board and keep them aside.
        Take one mixing bowl and add all purpose flour, corn flour, salt, garam masala,
        coriander powder, ginger and garlic paste and mix it well. Then add some water to
        form a thick paste.
        </li>
        <li>
        Add all the chopped vegetables in the paste and mix well. Let the vegetables
        marinated for about 2 hours so that the veggies are properly covered with the paste.
        Now put a deep frying pan on high flame and add oil in it.
        </li>
        <li>
        Deep fry all the vegetables till golden brown. Then take out the veggies and place on
        a paper towel to remove the extra oil from it. Now take another frying pan and and
        add 2 tbsp oil in it and let it heat for some time over medium flame. Meanwhile,
        crush the red chillies with a little water and make a smooth red chilli paste with
        pestle and mortar
        </li>
        <li>
        Now add finely chopped onions in oil along with finely chopped ginger and garlic
        and saute for 2-3 minutes, until the onion becomes translucent and pinkish in colour.
        Add 1 tsp of red chilli paste in it. Also, add the tomato sauce, vinegar, soya sauce and
        salt carefully as soya sauce also contain salt so keep a check on taste and add 1 tsp of
        chilli sauce as well to the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
        Take one bowl separately and add 1 tbsp of corn flour in it and dilute it with water.
        Now, add it in the sauce prepared to make it thick. Add all fried vegetables to the
        sauce. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve hot!

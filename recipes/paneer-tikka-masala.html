    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Paneer Tikka Masala is a popular Indian curry where
        ubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese), onions and
        peppers are marinated with yogurt and spices, grilled
        and then tossed in a creamy tomato based curry.
        This dish goes extremely well with butter naan
        or paratha or basmati rice.

        You know the most famous Indian food in the world?
        It is Chicken Tikka Masala, at least that's what
        I think. You talk to anyone in the UK or USA and
        even if they don't know much about Indian food they
        definitely know about chicken tikka masala.
        I think the dish is synonyms with Indian food in the
        west. The vegetarian version of it is of course
        Paneer Tikka Masala which is also quite popular and
        you would find it on the menu of most Indian restaurants.
